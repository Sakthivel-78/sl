    <p><b>In a multicellular organism</b> an organ is <strong>a collection of tissues </strong> <i>a collection of tissues joined in a structural unit to serve a common function</i>.
        <em>In the hierarchy of life</em>, an organ lies between <small>tissue and an organ system</small> 
        Tissues are formed from same type cells to act together in a function. 
        Tissues of different types combine to form an organ which has a specific function. 
        The intestinal wall <mark>for example is formed by epithelial tissue and smooth muscle tissue</mark>
        <del>Two or more organs working together in the execution of a specific body function form an organ system</del>. 
        <ins>An organ's tissues can be broadly categorized as parenchyma, the functional tissue, and stroma,</ins> <sub>the structural tissue with supportive, connective, or ancillary functions.</sub> 
        <sup>For example, the gland's tissue that makes the hormones is the parenchyma, whereas the stroma</sup> includes the nerves that innervate the parenchyma, the blood vessels that oxygenate and nourish it and carry away its metabolic wastes, 
        the connective tissues that provide a suitable place for it to be situated and anchored. The main tissues that make up an organ tend to have <ol>common embryologic origins</ol>, such as arising from the same germ layer. 
        Organs exist in most multicellular organisms. <u>In single-celled organisms such as members of the eukaryotes</u>, the functional analogue of an organ is known as an <ul>organelle. In plants, there are three main organs</ul></p>
